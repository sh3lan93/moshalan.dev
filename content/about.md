👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed Shalan — a senior mobile software engineer with over 9 years of experience specializing in **Android (Kotlin & Java)** and **Flutter**. I build high-performance, scalable mobile apps with clean architecture and a focus on product impact.

I’ve worked across various industries, building apps used by thousands of users daily, and contributing to systems that combine both native and cross-platform technologies.

## 🔧 What I Do

- Architect and develop mobile apps using **modern Android (Jetpack Compose, ViewModel, Flow)** and **Flutter**
- Create and maintain **multi-module projects** with clean separation of concerns
- Maintain developer workflows using **Gradle plugins**, **Bitrise**, and **Codemagic**
- Improve performance and detect UI jank with **custom logcat parsing tools**

---

## 🧠 What I Believe In

- **Simplicity with purpose**: I aim for maintainable solutions that solve real product problems
- **Platform thinking**: I design reusable components and systems across teams and modules
- **Metrics-driven**: I rely on performance and usage data to guide improvements
- **Continuous growth**: I'm always learning and helping others grow — through mentorship, documentation, and collaboration

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

I'm actively working toward the **Staff Engineer (IC4)** level. My main areas of focus right now:

- Driving architecture across modules and platforms
- Improving dev experience through better tooling and CI integration
- Leading cross-cutting performance initiatives

---

## 🧪 Side Projects & Experiments

- 🛠 Built a **Gradle plugin** that injects analytics tracking using annotations and ASM
- 🔍 Developed tools to detect **jank frames** from UI test logs
